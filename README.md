# Your Own Budget Book Planner :seedling:

## A budget planner application to make your day a lot more organized! :sparkles:

In this **Budget Planner Application**, user will be able to:
- The display menu of the budget planner will be shown along with some options for the categories
- Give the user the option to add the amount of money spent into a certain category to the budget planner

This Budget Planner Application will be targeted to all ages but will be focused 
more to people who enjoy planning and being organized. Students, including myself,
have difficulty at times to control their spending and in my opinion having a budget planner
will be a helpful tool. I sparked an interest in making this application because I really enjoy 
being organized, and I do think many people should be encouraged to use a budget planner.
